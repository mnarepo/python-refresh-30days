# Day 01 (Python Refresh)

## What I did
- Set up repo structure (notes/projects/datasets)
- Practiced Python basics: input/output, types, validation, arithmetic
- Solved mini practice tasks (8 problems)

## What I learned
- Converting input safely matters
- Small practice is better than only watching videos

## Next
Day 02: if/elif/else + operators + real-life problems
